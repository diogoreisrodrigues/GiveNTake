                    The conception for the digital game started when we had our first meeting with the client.
                    We discussed the client's vision and goals for the project, and we were able to get a better understanding of what they wanted to achieve.
                    They showed us some examples of games the patients at CISM liked and explained what they liked about them.
                    And so we started brainstorming ideas for the game.

                    The Result of this Brainstorming was the creation of a bunch of prototypes for a future game that would help the patients at CISM improve their math skills.
                    This ideas were all inspired on the games that the team at CISM showed us.

                    After the client approved the prototypes, we started working on the game.
                    We quickly created a working prototype for two mini-games that would be part of the final game.

                    The feedback we got was very positive, and the patients were excited to play the game again.
                    But we also received some suggestions for improvements, so we went back to the drawing board to make the necessary changes.

                    Particulary from the our client who expressed the desire to have a game that could be played by more than one person, as such that the patients could have some sort of interaction between themselves.
                    So the team went back to brainstorming ideas for the game, this time one that could be played ideally by 4 people at once.

                    After the brainstorming session, we started working on the new ideas for the game.
                    We created a new prototype that included a multiplayer mode, where up to 4 players could play together.
                    This new game mode brought new challenges, it consists of two teams of two players each, where each team has to work together to solve math problems and beat the other team.
                    This math problems come in the form of small cards like the ones you see in the video.
                    Each card has a value and the users need to drag the coins to match the value of the card.

                    With this new prototype we went back to CISM to test it with the patients.
                    The feedback we got was very positive, the patients loved the new multiplayer mode and the interaction it brought.
                    But they also gave us some important feedback, as you can see in the video, one card spawns randomly in each side after 10 seconds
                    but what would end up happening was that they would complete the cards and had to wait sometimes some time for the next card to appear
                    which showed us that the cards needed to spawn right after they complete them and that there should always be 4 cards one the game at all times, one for each player.

                    Now it was time to make the necessary changes to the game.
                    We added a new feature that would spawn a new card right after the players completed one.
                    We also made sure that there would always be 4 cards on the game at all times, one for each player.
                    On top of this we made the game give a lot of visual feedback when the game ends, making it so that if the time runs out a popUp appears showing the score of each team.
                    Lastly before the game starts we added a small tutorial that explains the rules of the game to the players, so that they could unerstand them better and not be so lost/.

                    Something that the client also asked us to add was a screen for the terapist.
                    We noticed that most games for the interactive table were designed to be played by the patients,
                    but the terapist also needed a way to interact with the game.
                    So we added a second screen that would allow the terapist to control the game, start and stop it, and make some changes dpeending on the game,
                    like changing the time ou the points.

                    Finally we went back to CISM to test the final version of the game.
                    It was not perfect but the work of the time could be seen. Altough we wanted to do a lot more the final product was very good.
                    The feedback we got was very positive, the patients loved the game and the terapists were happy with the results.
                    The game was a success and it was now ready to be used by the patients at CISM.
