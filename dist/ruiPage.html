                    We are proud to introduce a unique and inclusive gaming experience developed in collaboration with the esteemed Centro de Inclusão Social da Madeira (CISM).

                    CISM is dedicated to promoting and developing comprehensive support actions aimed at ensuring the functional and holistic development of individuals with disabilities.

                    Following this line of thought the board game was aimed to reflect the values of CISM, aiming to create an engaging and learning environment for people in the center with certain disabilities.

                    In line with our commitment to inclusivity and empowerment, we are thrilled to highlight the Café Inclusão project, a key initiative within the Centro de Inclusão Social da Madeira (CISM). This inspiring project aims to promote autonomy and integration into the workforce for individuals with disabilities.

                    The Board game was designed with this mission in mind. We aspire to create engaging and educational experiences that not only entertain but also equip players with skills and confidence, enabling individuals to develop the competencies needed to thrive in the workforce and, ultimately, contribute to projects like Café Inclusão.                  </div>

                    We engaged in dynamic brainstorming sessions to generate and  refine ideas for our board and digital games. We considered various  gameplay mechanics, educational objectives, and design elements that  could best serve our mission. This collaborative process involved  extensive debate and discussion, allowing us to weigh the pros and cons  of different concepts and arrive at a cohesive vision for our games.

                    After several playtests and refinements, we developed the complete versions of Give n' Take board game, incorporating all the adjustments and feedback from the previous playtests.

                    The final  versions featured fully realized designs, comprehensive educational  content, and user-friendly assets. We conducted a last playtest  with our target audience to ensure the game was engaging, accessible,  and effective in teaching money management skills while being fun. This final round of  testing confirmed the games' readiness for operation, marking the culmination of our development process.                  </div>
