                    The conception for the digital game started when we had our first meeting with the client. We discussed the client's vision and goals for the project and gained a better understanding of what they wanted to achieve. They showed us examples of games that the patients at CISM liked and explained what they enjoyed about them. Thus, we began brainstorming ideas for the game.

                    The result of this brainstorming was the creation of several prototypes for a future game that would help the patients at CISM improve their math skills. These ideas were all inspired by the games that the team at CISM showed us.

                    After the client approved the prototypes, we started working on the game. We quickly created a working prototype for two mini-games that would be part of the final game.

                    After making the first prototype, we tested it with the patients at CISM. We wanted to see if they enjoyed the game and if it was helping them improve their math skills. The feedback we received was very positive, and the patients were excited to play the game again. However, we also received some suggestions for improvements, so we went back to the drawing board to make the necessary changes.

                    As we mentioned, after testing, we received some interesting feedback. Particularly from our client, who expressed the desire to have a game that could be played by more than one person so that the patients could interact with each other. So, the team went back to brainstorming ideas for the game, this time one that could ideally be played by four people at once.

                    After the brainstorming session, we started working on the new ideas for the game. We created a new prototype that included a multiplayer mode where up to four players could play together. This new game mode brought new challenges. It consists of two teams of two players each, where each team has to work together to solve math problems and beat the other team. These math problems come in the form of small cards, like the ones you see in the video. Each card has a value, and the users need to drag the coins to match the value of the card.

                    With this new prototype, we went back to CISM to test it with the patients. The feedback we received was very positive; the patients loved the new multiplayer mode and the interaction it brought. However, they also gave us some important feedback. As you can see in the video, one card spawns randomly on each side every 10 seconds. What ended up happening was that they would complete the cards and then have to wait for the next card to appear. This showed us that the cards needed to spawn immediately after they are completed and that there should always be four cards in the game at all times, one for each player.

                    Now it was time to make the necessary changes to the game. We added a new feature that would spawn a new card right after the players completed one. We also ensured that there would always be four cards in the game at all times, one for each player. Additionally, we incorporated visual feedback for when the game ends, including a popup that appears showing the score of each team when the time runs out. Lastly, before the game starts, we added a small tutorial that explains the rules to the players, helping them understand the game better and not feel lost.

                    The client also asked us to add a screen for the therapist. We noticed that most games for the interactive table were designed to be played by the patients, but the therapist also needed a way to interact with the game. So, we added a second screen that would allow the therapist to control the game, start and stop it, and make some changes depending on the game, such as adjusting the time or the points.

                    Finally, we returned to CISM to test the final version of the game. While it wasn't perfect, the progress we had made was evident.

The feedback we received was overwhelmingly positive; the patients loved the game, and the therapists were pleased with the results. The game was a success, and it was now ready to be used by the patients at CISM.
